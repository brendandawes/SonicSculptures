Sonic Sculptures for 10 x 10
============================

![808 State](https://www.dropbox.com/s/svt4602srz33bx4/808State_.png?dl=0?raw=true "Model")


Created for the [DesignMCR](http://designmcr.com) 10 x 10 exhibition that took place in Manchester 18th September â€“ 21st September 2014.

Each model was created in Processing, scaled, made hollow and printed on a Makerbot Replicator 2 3D Printer.

Download each model and use your favourite 3D printer or 3D printing service to create your own exhibition.

Note that because of the support structure required, printing times are considerable. Therefore using an online printing service such as Shapeways may be fairly costly.

Tracks are:

Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart

808 State - Pacific State

The Smiths - How Soon Is Now

The Stone Roses - Waterfall

The Bee Gees - Stayin' Alive

The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)

Elbow - One Day Like This

Inspiral Carpets - This is How it Feels to be Lonely
