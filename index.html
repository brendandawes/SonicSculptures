<p>Created for the DesignMCR 10 x 10 exhibition that took place in Manchester 18th September â€“ 21st September 2014.</p>

<p>Each model was created in Processing, scaled, made hollow and printed on a Makerbot Replicator 2 3D Printer.</p>

<p>Download each model and use your favourite 3D printer or 3D printing service to create your own exhibition.</p>

<p>Note that because of the support structure required, printing times are considerable. Therefore using an online printing service such as Shapeways may be fairly costly.</p>

<p>Tracks are:</p>

<p>Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart</p>

<p>808 State - Pacific State</p>

<p>The Smiths - How Soon Is Now</p>

<p>The Stone Roses - Waterfall</p>

<p>The Bee Gees - Stayin' Alive</p>

<p>The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)</p>

<p>Elbow - One Day Like This</p>

<p>Inspiral Carpets - This is How it Feels to be Lonely</p>
